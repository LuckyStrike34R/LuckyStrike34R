About me:
- Hi! My name is Alexander, I am a novice testing specialist. I came into the field of testing from scratch, because I want to change my field of activity. I chose this area because I like to find bugs and look for new aspects in the software. I am currently studying at the software testing engineer course from Hexlet and plan to develop in this field.
- As part of the training project - "Testing an online store" - I conducted a full cycle of testing, starting with the creation of test documentation and ending with regression testing. I also participate in the program for testers - Vk Testers from vk.com where I test services, games, third-party applications and the VK client itself on various platforms. I do not have bad habits, I am fond of sports.
